one compile error:

ClockSolver.java:62: error: non-static variable DEFAULT_TIME_SLICE_SECONDS cannot be referenced from a static context
        while (clock.tick(DEFAULT_TIME_SLICE_SECONDS) <= 43200) {
                          ^
1 error

I repaired this error by putting "cse" in front of the constant name, since it is an instance variable
recompiled OK

gets exceptions when running "java Clock" because the code in main() is not catching the exception that
   is being thrown on the hard-coded out of range errors.  The very first one is out of range, and it
   throws an exception which is not caught, cauing the program to stop right there.  The remaining
   code in the Clock class main() is never executed.
