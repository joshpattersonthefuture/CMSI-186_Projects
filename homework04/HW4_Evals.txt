A total of one point each for the following:

class Clock             : Exists, coding style acceptable   -  1 point
Constructor             : Freebie, since not really needed  -  1 point
tick                    : works                             -  1 point
getHourHandAngle        : works                             -  1 point
getMinuteHandAngle      : works                             -  1 point
getHandAngle            : works                             -  1 point
getTotalSeconds         : works                             -  1 point
toString                : works                             -  1 point
main exists             : Exists                            -  1 point
Test Code               : Contains some method test code    -  1 point
   the way this is structured, you don't catch the exceptions that are thrown
     so the program will never test more than the first attenpt at calling
     the Clock constructor.  I would have to take off 1/2 point, but you
     wrote a bunch of nice code.....  if you have questions about this,
     feel free to ask me about it

class ClockSolver       : Exists, coding style acceptable   -  1 point
Constructor             : Exists, works properly            -  1 point
HandleInitialArguments  : works                             -  0 point (0/7)
   didn't handle situation with no arguments; throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
   didn't handle any of the bogus argument situations; see "clocktestcases.bat"
main exists             : works                             -  1 point
works as advertised     : passes all tests in the series    -  4.5 points
   none of the test cases got any output, other than "Welcome to ClockSolver"
   there is code, though, so I'm giving you 1/2 credit

Files in Git            : two files required                -  2 points
Coding Style overall    : coding style acceptable           -  1 point


Total 19.50 out of 27 = 72.22% which is a C
