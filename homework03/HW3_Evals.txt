=========================================

A total of one point each for the following:

class Die         : Exists, coding style acceptable   - 1 point
constructor       : works                             - 1 point
roll              : works                             - 1 point
getValue          : works                             - 1 point

class toString    : works                             - 1 point
main for testing  : Exists, with some tests in it     - 1 point

class DiceSet     : Exists, coding style acceptable
                     didn't initially compile, and it
                     is just a copy of Die.java but
                     I'll count it for you anyhow     - 1 point
constructor       : works                             - 1 point
sum               : works                             - 1 point
roll              : works                             - 1 point
rollIndividual    : works                             - 1 point
getIndividual     : works                             - 1 point
instan. toString  : works                             - 1 point
class toString    : works                             - 1 point
isIdentical       : works                             - 1 point
main for testing  : Exists, with some tests in it     - 1 point

class HighRoll    : Exists, coding style acceptable   - 1 point
TUI:              : works, all options present        - 0 point
option 1 roll all : works                             - 0 point
option 2 roll one : works                             - 0 point
option 3 sum      : works                             - 0 point
option 4 save     : works                             - 0 point
option 5 display  : works                             - 0 point
option 6 quit     : works                             - 0 point

Files in Git      : all three present                 - 1 point
Test Harness      : Won't compile with your code
                     46 compile errors                - 0 point
HighRoll          : Won't compile
                    Only has one set of dice allowed
                     intent was different             - 0 points

Total 20 out of 30 = 66.67% which is a D


SORRY FOR THE LOW SCORE, JOSH -- YOUR DICESET.JAVA FILE ISN'T A DICE SET,
JUST A COPY OF THE DIE CLASS.  YOUR HIGHROLL.JAVA DOESN'T COMPILE.  YOUR
CODE THEREFORE ISN'T MATCHING WITH THE TEST HARNESS.

IF YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT ANYTHING, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONSULT WITH ME
DURING OFFICE HOURS OR AT THE "HOPE" SESSION ON WEDNESDAY AT NOON, IN
THE REGULAR CLASS ROOM.
