=======================================================

A total of one point each for the following,
   except where noted:

BrobInt add method                  : 1 point
BrobInt subtract method             : 1 point
BrobInt validate digits method      : 1 point
BrobInt reverser method [of 2]      : 2 points

BrobInt Tester class                : 1 point
BrobInt add [of 9]                  : 4 points
BrobInt subtract [of 7]             : 0 points
BrobInt mult [of 7, 1 pt. EC]       : 1 point
BrobInt div [of 2, 1 pt. EC]        : 0 point
BrobInt remainder [of 2, 1 pt. EC]  : 0 point

Fib class file exists               : 1 point compile error
Fib constructor                     : 1 point
Fib input error handling            : 1 point
Fib output correct number [of 4]    : 0 points

All of the Fibonacci tests produced the same error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0
        at BrobInt.toString(BrobInt.java:262)
        at Fibonacci.Fibonacci(Fibonacci.java:29)
        at Fibonacci.main(Fibonacci.java:37)



Minimum three files in repo (3)     : 3 points
All files compile (3)               : 3 points
Coding Style                        : 0 points

Your BrobInt.java code initially did not compile.  A big
   part of the problem is your inconsistent indentation
   style.  Make sure you indent consistently, and you will
   have fewer problems like this:

BrobInt.java:276: error: reached end of file while parsing
    }
     ^
1 error

Your Fibonacci class also did not initially compile.  I fixed the
compile errors at no cost to you, since they were easy fixes and
I could be sure I wouldn't break anything.
